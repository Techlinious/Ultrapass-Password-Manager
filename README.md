# Ultrapass-Password-Manager
A simple side project I am working on outside of school, will continue to update if people are interested.


NOTE 1; The program hasn't been 'Published' yet, so windows may freak out when you try to open it.

NOTE 2; There are still many bugs, so feel free to provide feedback

NOTE 3; Passwords.csv must be included in the same folder as the exe

NOTE 4; If you forget your master password, you won't be able to decrypt the csv file.
