# Ultrapass-Password-Manager
A simple side project I am working on outside of school, will continue to update if people are interested.


NOTE 1; The program hasn't been 'Published' yet, so windows may freak out when you try to open it. The reason for this is because the password manager has access to system.IO. This is only used to store, retrieve and create a folder where the passwords are stored and encrypted.

NOTE 2; There are still many bugs, so feel free to provide feedback

NOTE 3; There isn't a folder so store passwords straight away, you have to open the manager and store your first password, at which point, it will create a file called 'Passwords.csv'. This is where your passwords will be encrypted and stored to. 

NOTE 4; If you forget your encryption key, you lose access to your passwords. I will not be held responsible for this.

NOTE 5; Updates are planned to be released WEEKLY. some of these may be neccesary for your password security.
